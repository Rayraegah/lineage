Lineage â€“ A Genetic Algorithm for Breeding Creatures

@version 1.0.0
@author Rayraegah <rayraegah@gmail.com>

There are two part to the algorithm:
(1) parent gene swapping and
(2) mutation.

(1) Parent gene swapping
    This process is used to get recessive genes into the dominant slot.

    Here's an example:
        There's a creature with traits (D, R1, R2, R3).

    In the above example,
        D = Dominant trait
        R1 = Recessive trait 1
        R2 = Recessive trait 2
        R3 = Recessive trait 3

    When parent gene swapping there's a 25% chance it will swap R3 and R2,
    then R2 with R1, then R1 with D. This happens consequently which means
    the algorithm could end up swapping R3 down to R2, then to R1, then to
    D all in the same iteration. This is extremely unlikely which a chace of
    1.5%, which means R3 genes will less likely to become dominant in one
    step.

(2) Mutation
    This process can only happen after the genes are swapped. The gene swap
    randomizes the genes in different places. Mutation only happens on the
    dominant gene. Once mutated the genes are swapped so that the higher
    valued gene is G2. Some preconditions can be run before a mutation
    like gene2 - gene1 == 1 and is gene1 even or not.

    This algorithm needs both a specific combination of genes and the value
    to be even. The kai values have 1 added to to their binary. All of the
    math should be done in binary.

    After preconditions the mutation happens with a 25% probability if the
    value is less than 23 and half of that otherwise. The mutation is just as
    predictable e.g. mutation = (gene1 / 2) + 16.
